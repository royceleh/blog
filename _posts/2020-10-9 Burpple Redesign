title: Burpple Redesign
---

I have recently been trying out Figma (total beginner) and decided to practice by working on an idea that I had in mind.

Burpple is a food discovery community platform in Singapore and Malaysia, where users can view photo-reviews by others and post their own. It's like as a vertical community decoupled from Instagram, with more features such as offering 1-for-1 deals. 
The problem statement that I was keen to address was to make Burpple’s app more engaging. This matters for users because a better designed app will help them discover new food places more easily and achieve their goal of using Burpple. At the same time, having more engaged users increases ad revenue for the business, and ties in with Burpple’s goal of being the ‘only dining app you need’.

You can view the google slide deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/100gH_3HRORE4NNA4aTMciVnmxn0TXuOCftkgegdeYjM/edit?usp=sharing) for more context and elaboration. The actual Figma prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/1uloJIxSLVGkojZkHlvMJT/Burpple---Royce?node-id=32%3A56&scaling=scale-down)!
