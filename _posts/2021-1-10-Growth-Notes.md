### Prelude

Having briefly worked on user retention during my time at ShopBack, I was keen to find out more about growth, without enrolling in paid courses/programs. This is a non-exhaustive compilation of learnings from the free blogposts of several thought leaders in this field, namely:

1. Reforge / Brian Balfour (https://www.reforge.com/blog, https://brianbalfour.com)
2. Andrew Chen (https://andrewchen.co)
3. Casey Winters (https://caseyaccidental.com)
4. Lenny Rachitsky (https://www.lennyrachitsky.com)

### What is Growth?

Growth is about connecting more people to the core value of a product/service more frequently, using in-product levers in place of or in conjunction with external channels. While most product teams are built to create or improve the core value provided to customers, growth is a function which thinks about product and marketing together. After all, the best product doesn’t always win – it’s the one that everyone uses. Every company eventually realises that the single biggest lever that it has for maximising revenue potential is the number of users, and growth owns this flow of customers in and out of a product. According to Chamath Palihapitiya (ex-Facebook), three things are needed to build massive growth:

1. Build core product value
2. Get users to experience that core value as quickly as possible
3. Help users experience that core value as often as possible within a given time period

Firstly, you can’t sustainably grow something that sucks. Nothing replaces an incredible product and growth isn’t the solution to a product problem. However, having a great product doesn’t necessarily mean users will naturally come. Adding more features isn’t the solution to a growth problem.

While product teams own (1), growth teams should minimally own a large chunk of (2) and (3). By this definition, growth teams work on problems not too dissimilar from the AARRR framework, including acquisition, engagement, retention and monetisation. One key distinction is the emphasis on growth loops instead of funnel-like thinking.

### Growth Loops

The fastest growing products are better represented as a system of loops, not funnels. Growth loops are closed systems where the inputs through some process generates more of an output that can be reinvested in the input (compounding effect). In contrast, funnels necessitates putting more into the top to get more at the bottom, which is unsustainable. Loops force you to think about how one cohort of users can lead to another, and combine how your product, channel, and monetisation model work together in a single system rather than treating them as silos.

Here is an example on Pinterest by Reforge:
![growth2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/growth2.png)

Loops aren’t just conceptual, their efficiency can be measured. If you can get 1000 users to invite and sign up +600 of their friends, then you have a ratio of 0.6. Those 600 new users generate another 0.6*600=360 new users, who then generate 216, and so on, until the entire cohort is +1500 signups total from a base of 1000. Not all loops are created equally, and the fastest growing products are typically powered by 1- 2 major loops that transition over time. Measuring and understanding your loops is critical to understanding where to focus.

### Acquisition

Acquisition loops are how a cohort of new users leads to another set of new users. Some examples:

- User-generated content SEO: New users find content through Google, a small % of them sign up and generate more content, which then gets indexed by Google, and then the loop repeats. 
- Paid marketing: Spend money, sell products, take the money and buy more ads.
- Viral/referral: Users directly or indirectly share a product with their friends/colleagues, who then share with more people.
- Linear channels like PR, conferences and partnerships etc are important but they don’t scale. Instead, you use them to drive traffic into your loop, which then gets amplified. 

Acquisition channels:
- Properly testing any single channel is time consuming and requires focus. The quickest way to finding your first scalable channel with limited resources is to focus on one at a single time and iterate based on feedback just like you would with building a product. Most large companies get 80% of their growth from one channel anyway.
- Diversity of channels is not important in the early stage. Once you find a channel that is working at a small scale, instead of adding another channel to the mix, focus on optimising, scaling, and milking your initial channel for all its worth.
- It’s ok to pay for users. Every acquisition channel costs money directly or indirectly, even those that seems free such as SEO and viral (takes significant engineering and other employees’ time). These ‘free’ channels are certainly valuable in the long term but take time and in the early stages, speed of learning is the most valuable thing.
- When you are testing the viability of a channel, you need to try and make big improvements, not incremental ones. Save those for when you are ready to optimise and scale a channel.

Achieving network effect (a large user base) in the early stage is challenging and comes with a huge hurdle: The chicken or the egg problem. There are two versions of the chicken or the egg problem and each has a different solution.
- Platforms/Marketplaces: When your product connects two different types of groups. The value to each group of users is dependent on the use of the other group. Solution: In the early stages, create value for one group of users that is not dependent on the other group of users (example by initially supplying one side yourself). In other words, you have to be an app before you can be a platform (or marketplace).
- Communities/Social Networks: When your product connects people of similar type to create broader value. The value to each individual user grows the more users in the overall community. Solution: In the early stages, decrease the size of your target audience (example Facebook launched by targeted just Harvard’s campus). Getting network density among a smaller audience is exponentially easier.
- No matter which chicken or the egg problem you are solving for, don’t be afraid of using brute force.

CAC: For internal operations and decision-making, average CAC is almost always useless as it hides insights. To make CAC truly useful as an operating metric, segment based on:
- Customer type/attribute: Most companies have different types of customers who behave very differently and may cost different amounts within the same channels, have different conversion rates, and much much more. 
- Channel: Different acquisition channels will produce very different CAC numbers since the costs, conversion rates, and other factors will vary widely between channels. The issue with this segmentation is that it depends on an accurate attribution model.
- Geographies/location: At a minimum you should be looking at CAC segmented based on country but for some companies, looking at CAC on a location by location basis can be key to making operating decisions and gathering new insights.  

Another common mistake is looking at CAC in the short term and not understanding the long term context surrounding the number:
- Channel-based context: Different acquisition channels evolve differently and as a result so does CAC. For instance, with content marketing, older pieces of content from can still attract traffic in the future without additional investment, resulting in more leads and lower CAC over time. 
- Network-based context: For products that are based on marketplaces or network effects, CAC (for supply or demand) can typically start high, but then decrease over time when there is a higher volume on both sides of the market.
- Saturation-based context: Saturation in a channel will make CAC higher in the long term.  
- Don’t be fooled by average CAC, or by the assumption that costs stay static.

### Activation / Onboarding

You need to define what successful activation is before you can measure it: What does it mean to have someone habitually using your product (key action + frequency)? Activation is from the moment your user starts using your product and connects with your core value proposition, all the way until a habit is formed.

With onboarding, you want to get users to experience the core product as fast as possible  with the minimum amount of information you need. Remove all other friction that distracts the user from experiencing product value. New users are not like existing users, in that they are trying to understand the basics of how to use a product and what to do next. Thus, a key element of successful onboarding is removing everything but the basics of the product until those basics are understood. 

While you should strive for a design that doesn’t need explanation, don’t be afraid to educate if it helps in this way. Contextually explain to the user what they could do next on the current screen. As your product expands to more users, the first mile will need to be even simpler and account for vastly different groups of new users. Prime them to the point where they know three things: (1) why they’re here, (2) what they can accomplish, (3) and what to do next.

### Engagement

Retention (explained later) measures breadth – the percentage of users who are still active in a given time period, but it doesn’t answer how active they are within that period. It’s the measure of your product’s engagement that will answer that depth. Your product could have great retention, but without engagement it probably won’t become a big business as the success of a product’s revenue model correlates with its users’ depth of engagement (more transactions, more ads or more add-on services). It is the function of the two combined that makes a great business.

Engagement loops are how a set of active users can lead to the engagement of another set of users or engagement in a future time period. Some examples:
- Social feedback: One user messages/follows/mentions another, and draws them back. And then that user might do the same, and draw in a different user. And this repeats. Strong network density and easy content creation is important in facilitating this.
- Planting seeds: When a user shares information about their preferences, the product can then re-engage the user in the future with personalised content. Examples include telling Netflix which shows you like, or setting notifications for when a product’s price drops in the future.
- There are linear channels such as PR and promotions to re-engage users that are useful but they don’t scale. It’s better when users re-engage each other or when users re-engage themselves.

How can you build on top of your users’ natural frequency: Is there a ‘ladder of engagement’ where users come for one use case, but ultimately become stickier and higher frequency by adding more use cases? If you can upsell new use cases, increase frequency, increase feature usage or increase intensity, then there’s a ton of upside to be gained.

### Retention

Retention matters a lot. It accelerates everything else: To grow, we need to accumulate customers and not only acquire them. Some benefits of strong retention include:
- Acquisition: As you retain more users, these additional users take more of the key actions that accelerate acquisition, such as sharing, inviting or creating content.
- Monetisation: By retaining a larger proportion of a cohort, you can make more money from that cohort within a given period of time. You can also increase the length of time that a cohort retains, increasing LTV.
- CAC and Payback period: With stronger monetisation, you can (a) pay more to acquire a customer (pushing competitors out) and (b) reinvest in acquisition earlier to fuel growth as your payback period is shortened.

Retention is an output of activation, engagement and resurrection. This means that you can’t optimise it directly – instead, you will need to work on one of the inputs.
- Activation: Think about any retention curve, the steepest part is always at the very beginning.
- Engagement: Increase the depth of usage to increase the likelihood of users staying for the long-term.
- Resurrection: Reactivating churned users is also important, but this a high cost and high risk initiative that should come after you have great activation and engagement in place.

Choosing the right retention metric involves defining the core action that your user takes in your product and the intended time period / frequency that they should do it. In other words, what qualifies a user as active? It’s possible for great products to influence the natural frequency of usage as the product and its relationship with its users mature. 

Retention can differ greatly across different categories for a bunch of factors such as customer type and variability, revenue model, acquisition strategy and network effects amongst others. Every product is unique and instead of benchmarking retention, you should derive the optimal rate that will help you reach your long-term goals. Nonetheless, benchmarks may still serve as useful references. Lenny Rachitsky (ex-Airbnb) surveyed growth practitioners to find out what they think is good and great user retention (% of users who signed up and are still active six months later) to build massively successful businesses: 
- Consumer Social: ~25% is good, ~45% is great
- Consumer Transactional: ~30% is good, ~50% is great
- Consumer SaaS: ~40% is good, ~70% is great
- SMB / Mid-Market SaaS: ~60% is good, ~80% is great
- Enterprise SaaS: ~70% is good, ~90% is great

Although retention is an important metric to get right, there are cases where a lower retention rate is okay, such as if you’re just starting out, if you can acquire new users cheaply or if you’re not building a venture-scale business. With increased competition, channel fatigue and the rise of monopolies in tech who have the money to buy their way into the market. retention is only going to get challenging.

### Monetisation

There is a false belief that monetisation always comes at the expense of growth. Your monetisation model enables or disables growth loops in your overall growth model and if you understand your growth model, you will be able to make improvements to monetisation that enable growth. For instance, if you’re a SaaS business, a high pricing tier helps to enable a sales-assisted model while a low pricing tier reduces the friction for a touch-less sales model.

Price is just one of several monetisation levers. What you charge for, how often you charge, how your price scales, how you combine and package all of those things, and how you communicate it are a few examples of the other levers.

### Metrics

Input metrics are leading indicators while output metrics are lagging indicators. By definition, it can take time for the output to reflect positive or negative changes in the inputs. Monitor output metrics to know how you’re doing, but build experiments around the input metrics that you can directly influence.

A single north star metric only captures one dimension of your business. At a minimum, there are three key buckets for every product: retention, engagement and monetisation. No metric exists in isolation and to truly understand how one single metric impacts growth, you need to monitor its effects on other metrics and observe tradeoffs.
- Select a constellation of metrics. The search for one key metric oversimplifies how the ecosystem works and prevents anyone from focusing on understanding the different elements of that ecosystem.
- Break your output metrics into their input metrics. Drill down until you’ve got a set of actionable input metrics that you can impact directly, and then build your experiments to move those. You need to be willing to discard them quickly if after some experimentation you find moving them doesn’t improve the output metric.
- Understand and monitor your tradeoff metrics. Since many metrics are interdependent, for every metric you try to improve, determine where in your business you are likely to see a counter-reaction. Then, work to find a healthy balance.

### Growth Model

A growth model is a way to conceptualise and summarise your business in a simple equation that tells you what the different variables in your business are and how they explain how your business will grow. This will serve a valuable framework to help you make good decisions. It helps to assemble individual metrics into a big picture, and force you to think about their relationships and the relative importance.

Andy Johns (ex-Facebook) on a basic growth equation: Sustainable Growth = Top of funnel (Traffic, Conversion) * Magic moment (Emotional Response) * Core product value (Legitimacy of the Problem)

You can also map your customer journey to the finish line, step by step, and identify an appropriate metric for each significant step, to build an equation. Regardless, you should realistically have different segments that behave differently and build a model for each. All data in aggregate is crap. Segment or die. 

Growth models and equations are theoretical – they need to be tested and iterated. Driving growth is a process and so is creating a growth model. It is not something you do once and forget about.

### Adjacent Users

Adjacent users are those who are aware of a product and possibly tried using it, but are not able to successfully become an engaged user. This is typically because the current product positioning or experience has too many barriers to adoption for them. You will start to see the effect of the adjacent user show up in your cohorts by monitoring conversion from one state to the next (example: signed up to activated). When you see a decline from cohort to cohort over time, it is likely because there is some segment of adjacent users that are entering that state and struggling to convert to the next.

The process is to lay out multiple hypotheses of who the adjacent users are, choose which one to focus on strategically, force your team to look at the product through their lens, experiment and talk to customers to validate and learn, then update the landscape to make your next choice. To understand your adjacent users, it is helpful to understand the attributes of who is successful today and why they are successful. Your adjacent user is different on one or more of these attributes (but not all). These attributes create vectors of expansion. The adjacent user is not about capturing one large definition at once, it is about layering on micro definition after micro definition. But just because these users exist, does not mean you should choose to serve them. The key here is that the segment still needs to align with the strategic direction of where the product is going

Rapid success in your first audience will inherently lead to saturation and declining growth in that segment. The art is selecting the right groups of adjacent users to go after next. If you try to solve all problems for everyone, you’ll drown across too many issues and waste time acquiring users who have no chance of being successful today. It is critical for growth teams to be continually defining who the adjacent user is, to understand why they are struggling, to build empathy for the adjacent user, and ultimately to solve their problems.

### Experimentation

A test is an action that generates an output. Experimentation is a broad, repeatable system with testing as one of its steps. Experimentation is not there just to help you optimise landing pages, but also to help you resolve some of your biggest unknowns. It is one of the most powerful methods for informing the core strategy. As your company grows and serves more users, the gap between your perception of users’ needs and the reality of what they actually want starts to widen. You can guess and rely on luck, or apply a scientific method to bridge the gap.

Experimentation forces you to break down problems into testable hypotheses. Running an A/B test without a hypothesis about the why behind your predicted result isn’t strategic or smart, it’s throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks.

Experimentation goes beyond “should we ship it” to develop deeper insights about your users to determine what you should do next. You have to focus on the overall “learning loop” that experimentation enables, not just the individual outputs. Most experiments fail. If you’re designing your experiments to only find wins, rather than to answer questions, then you’ll find disappointment, not growth. The learning from why an experiment fails is infinitely useful in helping you to find the bigger winners later on. 

### Growth as a Function

The growth process:

- Build a growth model that helps you identify the most impactful variables/levers around acquisition, retention, engagement and monetisation.
- Understand the psychology of users behind those variables/levers.
- Develop hypothesis-driven experiments informed by your growth model and user psychology.
- Apply the learnings back to your growth model and user psychology to get better over time.
- Get key executive support to convince other teams.

After defining the problems/areas in your company that have the biggest impact on growth, and combining this with the growth process, you will quickly realise that to execute effectively you need a cross functional team with a mix of eng, product, data, design, and marketing etc. You need to approach your growth strategy with the same discipline, effort, and investment as you do in your product strategy. 

Growth at the early stages means making big changes and measuring results pre and post-change to see what, if any, impact those changes created. If it’s immeasurable, then it’s likely that the change didn’t have the type of impact that an early stage product needs to see. As a company scales, growth teams start to test more incremental changes that can still make a major impact on the business. Experimenters can now isolate variables in each experiment and measure impact at an increasingly granular level. Sometimes, you still need to do more divergent experiments that test a totally new experience otherwise you can end up stuck in a local maxima. 

You have to balance the probability of success for an experiment, the impact it has if successful, and the resources required to test and implement. In a perfect world you focus on things that have high probability of success, high impact, and low resources required.

Growth is never done: There are always more experiments to run, learnings to be gained, and improvements to be made. Over time, things are always moving and you need to adapt:
- Product: Over time the core of your product will evolve (hopefully a lot) and as your product changes, what works for growth will change as well. What worked before will become obsolete.
- Audience: As you move through these stages and scale to more users, different audiences behave and respond to very different things (example Twitter’s onboarding changed from guiding early adopters to write their first tweet to guiding the early majority to following and consuming content first).
- Channel: User acquisition channels is an adapt or die environment and changes happen at both a macro (new channels) and micro (new rules in specific channels) level.
- Eventually, all playbooks will stop working. Don’t get attached to old playbooks, throw them when they are no longer relevant.
