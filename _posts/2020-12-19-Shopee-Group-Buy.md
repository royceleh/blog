title: Shopee Group Buy Prototype

My friends and I recently hacked together a submission in less than 24 hours for Shopee’s Product and Design challenge. 

For many years, the focus of e-commerce has been to optimise the single-player experience. 
Platforms ramped up merchant supply, personalised recommendations, seasonal shopping campaigns and delivery efficiency amongst others to deliver a delightful e-commerce experience for the individual end-user. 
Yet, one aspect of the shopping experience that e-commerce has yet to fully deliver on is social interaction. 
With high digital payments adoption and strong logistics networks already established, we believe that the e-commerce industry in Singapore is primed to go more social in the coming years, following the footsteps of Pinduoduo in China, and provide a ‘multi-player’ experience to help address consumers’ need to connect with others.

For users who want to connect with their peers when shopping on Shopee, we proposed a group purchase feature that allows users to form a group to purchase at a discounted price determined by the seller. By layering social and price discounts on top of a transaction, we hypothesised that this will incentivise users to authentically connect with others during their purchase journey and drive higher-quality / higher-intent shopping conversations. With the involvement of friends and family, Shopee will be able to provide users with a delightful social experience that is nearly synonymous to an offline shopping experience.
