Hi! 👋🏼

I enjoy thinking about product and business strategies, and analysing data. Currently in my final semester as a business analytics & accountancy undergrad at Nanyang Technological University, looking for opportunities to be part of a team tackling meaningful problems in the B2C space!

This simple wordpress is my personal challenge at honing my thinking and writing. I’m by no means an expert in writing or in any of these topics, but by making it public I’m hoping to push myself to commit to it.
